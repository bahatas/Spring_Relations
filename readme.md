    Hello dear students,

    In this project, you are going to practice :

        - Database Connection (H2 and Postgres),
        - Basic table creation, 
        - Establishing Relations,
        - Populate Tables with Data.sql file...

    This project is ready enough to start... You are responsible
    to write your code step by step in order to achieve:

    step_1 : establish H2 database cannection,
    step_2 : establish Postgres connection,
    step_3 : create tables via hibernate annotations,
    step_4 : establish entity relations (look into resources/static folder)
    step_5 : update tables with relations added
    step_6 : populate tables with Data.sql file...

    Thank you and have a nice time...
